      "passage": "The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the 'lungs of the Earth,' spans across nine countries in South America, with the majority located in Brazil. This vast ecosystem is home to approximately 10% of all species on Earth, including over 40,000 plant species, 1,300 bird species, and 3,000 types of fish. The rainforest plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate by absorbing massive amounts of carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. However, deforestation has become a major concern, with an estimated 17% of the forest lost in the last 50 years due to logging, agriculture, and urban development. Scientists warn that continued deforestation could have devastating effects on global weather patterns and biodiversity.",
